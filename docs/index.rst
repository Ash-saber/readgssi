`readgssi` |version| documentation
#####################################

Welcome to readgssi's documentation. This program was written to read and process ground-penetrating radar files from instruments made by Geophysical Survey Systems Incorporated (GSSI), although I have no affiliation with nor endorsement for the afforementioned organization.

`readgssi` is a tool intended for use as an open-source reader and preprocessing module for subsurface data collected with GSSI ground-penetrating radar (GPR) devices. It has the capability to read DZT and DZG files with the same pre-extension name and plot the data contained in those files.
