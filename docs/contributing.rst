Code contributions
*********************************

Contributions to this project are always welcome. If you have questions or comments about how this software works, I want to hear from you. Even if coding isn't your thing, I want to make it easier for you to get involved.

There is no formal structure for contributions at the moment, but I will respond promptly to any pull request or issue on github (https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi).

If and when you encounter bugs, kindly provide the error output, describe what you are attempting to do, and attach the DZT/DZX/DZG file(s) causing you trouble. If you have a question that involves sensitive data, send me an email confidentially at ian dot nesbitt at g mail dot com. Thanks for helping to keep software free and open-source!

Contributing in other ways
*********************************

:py:data:`readgssi` is open-source software written as a side project during the completion of my Master's degree at the University of Maine. It is written and maintained because it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside, and because it helps me do my own work.

If you would like to contribute by buying me a coffee, please seek me out at the next AGU, or drop me a couple bucks at https://paypal.me/IanNesbitt/. Thank you for your support, it is very much appreciated. Graduate student salaries aren't what they used to be!
