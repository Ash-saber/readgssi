`readgssi` is a tool intended for use as an open-source translator and preprocessing module for subsurface data collected with GSSI ground-penetrating georadar (GPR) devices. It has the capability to read DZT and DZG files with the same pre-extension name and plot the data contained in those files. `readgssi` is also currently able to translate most DZT files to CSV and will be able to translate to multiple other output formats including HDF5 and SEG-Y, though not all formats are available yet (see [future](#future)). Original Matlab code developed by Gabe Lewis, Dartmouth College Department of Earth Sciences. Python translation written with permission by Ian Nesbitt, University of Maine School of Earth and Climate Sciences.

## changes since 0.0.5
- fixed a bug that caused both plots of dual-channel radar files to be written out to one file
- fixed a bug that caused manually-created output file names to be ignored when plotting
- added basic background removal and dewow capability ([#5](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/pull/5) from [@fxsimon](https://github.com/fxsimon))
- added support for the D50800/D50300 antenna
  - added plotting support for dual-channel radar devices
  - merged [#3](https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi/pull/3) from [@fxsimon](https://github.com/fxsimon) which fixed a bug that caused multi-channel file traces to be read in a 121212 sequence instead of 111222
- updated the workings of the plotting algorithm's colormap
- changed the way files are saved (bug in 0.0.5 mangled some filenames)
- added the ability to specify colormap and whether to draw a colorbar and a histogram
- added an automatic figsize option (leaves figsize up to Matplotlib)
- added ability to apply gain
- fixed bug that caused gain to be applied incorrectly
- script now tries to automatically calculate timezero using (nsamp\*range)/position
#### known bugs:
- translation to anything but csv is broken (hope to have time to at least fix HDF5 output soon)
  - csv translation does not work for dual-channel radar devices (exports to file but channels are merged end-to-end)
- color bar shows up too large on some plots (no known fix yet)
- dewow doesn't work on all files

## usage
```
usage:
python readgssi.py -i input.DZT [OPTIONS]

optional flags:
    COMMAND     |      ARGUMENT       |       FUNCTIONALITY
-v, --verbose   |                     |  verbosity
-o, --output    | file:  /dir/f.ext   |  specify an output file
-f, --format    | string, eg. "csv"   |  specify output format (csv is the only working format currently)
-p, --plot      | +integer or "auto"  |  plot will be x inches high (dpi=150), or "auto". default: 10
-n, --noshow    |                     |  suppress matplotlib popup window and simply save a figure (useful for multiple file processing)
-c, --colormap  | string, eg. "Greys" |  specify the colormap ([https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html#grayscale-conversion](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html#grayscale-conversion))
-g, --gain      | positive float      |  apply a gain value (gain > 1: greater contrast; 0 < gain < 1: less contrast. default: 1)
-r, --bgr       |                     |  background removal algorithm (useful in ice, sediment, and water)
-w, --dewow     |                     |  dewow algorithm
-b, --colorbar  |                     |  add a colorbar to the figure
-a, --antfreq   | positive integer    |  specify antenna frequency (read automatically if not given)
-s, --stack     | +integer or "auto"  |  specify trace stacking value or "auto" to autostack to ~2.5:1 x:y axis ratio
-m, --histogram |                     |  produce a histogram of data values
```

From a unix command line:
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__001.DZT
```
Simply specifying an input DZT file like in the above command (`-i file`) will display a host of data about the file including:
- name of GSSI control unit
- antenna model
- antenna frequency
- samples per trace
- bits per sample
- traces per second
- L1 dilectric
- sampling depth
- number of traces
- number of seconds

## basic functionality
### CSV output
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__001.DZT -o test.csv -f CSV
```
Translates radar data to CSV format, which can be imported to, for example, `numpy` or `pandas` (or R, if that's your cup of tea).

### plotting
#### example 1A
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__001.DZT -p 5 -s auto
```
The above command will cause `readgssi` to save and show a plot named "DZT__001_100MHz.png" with a y-size of 6 inches at 150 dpi (`-p 6`) and the autostacking algorithm will stack the x-axis to some multiple of times shorter than the original data array for optimal viewing, approximately 2.5\*y (`-s auto`).
![Example 1a](examples/DZT__001_100MHz.png)

#### example 1B
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1b.png -p 5 -s auto -g 50 -m -r -w
```
This will cause `readgssi` to create a plot from the same file, but matplotlib will save the plot as "1b.png" (`-o 1b.png`). The script will plot the y-axis size (`-p 5`) and automatically stack the x-axis to (`-s auto`). The script will plot the data with a gain value of 50 (`-g 50`), which will increase the plot contrast by a factor of 50. The `-m` flag will draw a histogram for each data channel. Finally, `readgssi` will run the background removal (`-r`) and dewow (`-w`) filters.

![Example 1b histogram](examples/1b-h.png)

#### example 1C: gain can be tricky depending on your colormap
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1b.png -p 5 -s auto -r -w -c seismic
```
Here, background removal and dewow filters are applied, but no gain adjustments are made (equivalent to `-g 1`). The script uses matplotlib's "seismic" colormap (`-c seismic`) which is specifically designed for this type of waterfall array plotting. Even without gain, you will often be able to easily see very slight signal perturbations. It is not colorblind-friendly for either of the two most common types of human colorblindness, however, which is why it is not the default colormap.
![Example 1c](examples/1c.png)

#### example 2A: no background removal
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2a.png -p 10 -s 3 -c Greys -n
```
Here `readgssi` will create a plot of size 10 and stack 3x (`-p 10 -s 3`). Matplotlib will use the "Greys" colormap and save a PNG of the figure, but the script will suppress the matplotlib window (`-n`, useful for processing an entire directory full of DZTs at once).
![Example 2a](examples/2a.png)

#### example 2B: horizontal mean BGR algorithm applied
```
python readgssi.py -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2b.png -p 10 -s 3 -c Greys -n -r
```
The script does the same thing, except it applies a background removal. Note the difference in ringing artifacts between examples 2a and 2b.

## future
- GPS transcription (read from associated DZG file or CSV with fields `mark name, lon, lat, elev, time`)
- supplementing a flag indicating geophysical format (HDF5, SEGY, etc.) will write to that format
- calls to readgssi.readgssi(filename) from script or python shell will return np array and critical file statistics

## possible other future tools
- [irlib](https://github.com/njwilson23/irlib) integration (iir, timezero)
- usage of basic [obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy) filters?
